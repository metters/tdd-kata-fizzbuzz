# tdd-kata-fizzbuzz

The program illustrates an example of fizzbuzz, using TDD and serves as reference for my blog post on blog.senacor.com.
Please check the commit messages, where I tried to visualise the TDD cycle:
Each commit message is preceded by a keyword _RED_, _GREEN_, or _REFACTOR_.

The solution steps of this coding kata have been optimized for the blog article. Without it, the solution would probably
have looked quite different.
